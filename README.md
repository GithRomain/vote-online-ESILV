## Security

The question of the security of the data is really important on this project, we find many ways to respond to the client properly :

---
### Robots

ü§ñ To prevent robots from logging in and creating fake accounts to rig official elections. We used a captcha via the google [recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/) api

---
### Safe Login and actions

üîë We wanted to verify the authorization of users to access our website, which is why we use [JWTS](https://jwt.io/introduction) tokens to login and update any information in our database.

üîê And finally to prevent anyone from identifying themselves with an account that is not theirs, we have hashed user passwords using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to enhance authentication.

---
### Security of the database

üîí Even though mongoDB is already very secure, we have obviously encrypted all our data belonging to our users.

ü•∑ So as not to infringe on privacy and let customers vote anonymously and no one can see each other's votes even if we pass in simple reading our BDD

---
### Check informations

üëì Finally to reassure users our allow them to see, as long as any votes are open, their choice of vote. 

ü§ì So if there is any doubt about the integrity of our system, they can verify that their data does not change over time.
